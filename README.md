# Swellviews
This is a (soon to be) completed repository of a group project for CS321 which was not completed for reasons mostly outside of my own control. 

However, even though the class is over, I thought it would be worthwhile to finish the project not only to have a decently large and complex project in my repositories, but also so that I could get a more complete understanding of all the different parts of the application creation process.

When we first created this project, my main responsibility was to design and create the GUI. I felt I did a pretty good job considering it was my first time working with graphical elements, but refining was, and still is to a lesser degree, needed. 
Other areas also had room for improvement; like the search feature, for example, which was inconveniently case sensitive. 

But the biggest change was the account/user system. The goal was to have a way for users to create accounts with a username and password that they would use to store "collections" of movies. 
The majority of the collection system was completed, but very little of the account system was ever creted. 
So, I took it upon myself to complete this functionality along with the smaller improvements/finalizations to other areas. 

*Note: As of writing this README, the account system is still incomplete but should be ready before August 2022. If you're reading this after then, I just forgot to take this note out.
